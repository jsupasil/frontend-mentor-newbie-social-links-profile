## My process

### What I learned

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Shadow-box
- Object-fit

### What I learned

I learned how to design flex box, object-fit, box-shadow and other css properties. Flex box can also be applied for position alignments such as aligning element at center. Object-fit can be use to place the image at specific crop size with out changing its shape. There are some CSS properties that I have to search more and adjust to match with figma design such as drop shadow and border radious.

### Continued development

Learning categories could be link to other address.
